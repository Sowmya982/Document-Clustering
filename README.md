# Document-Clustering

Nowadays we are constantly bombarded with new content and new articles, a few hundred to thousand articles, related to various topics, are produced per day and so 
organisation of all these articles is essential or else old content gets lost as we try to accommodate the new one.Thus, an optimal method to identify and organise the arriving document with the old ones is absolutely essential.
Document clustering, a ML based approach where we apply cluster analysis to textual documents in our case articles (Wikipedia), thereby organising new articles and documents effectively for easy search and retrieval.By using this method, we can also ensure that the user who searches any document or article is not overwhelmed by the amount of content and ends up finding the right one faster.
